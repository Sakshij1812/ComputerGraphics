# ComputerGraphics
This is a computer graphics project that shows how a mobile (moving) source (i.e a car) communicates with a stationary destination (i.e a house) via satellite. It also demonstrates what happens when the source goes out of coverage area. It also demonstrates how a satellite bus (stationary) communicates with satellite outside the coverage area.
