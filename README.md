# ComputerGraphics
This is a computer graphics project that shows how a mobile (moving) source (i.e a car) communicates with a stationary destination (i.e a house) via satellite. It also demonstrates what happens when the source goes out of coverage area. In addition to that, it also shows how a satellite bus (stationary) communicates with satellite outside the coverage area.

This project is run on CodeBlocks and is written in C language using OpenGL library.
